## mateo.io

The source of my personal/portfolio website. It is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast static site generator written in [Go](https://golang.org/).

## Deployment

The site is hosted on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/). Ensure you have the [Firebase CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase-tools) installed and run the following:

```bash
$ hugo
$ firebase deploy
```

That's it! :smile:
